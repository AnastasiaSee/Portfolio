# School Name Matching

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a model for accurately predicting school names based on different variations of their spellings. Augmentation techniques and the RND-Full model are used to achieve high accuracy.

## Data
1. `schools.csv` - Dataset with standard school names.
2. `variations.csv` - Dataset with variations of school names.

## Data Preparation
1. Clean data by removing all characters except letters and spaces.
2. Use augmentation with typographical errors to increase the training set size.

## Model Training
1. Use RND-Full model to obtain embeddings for school names.
2. Find the nearest neighbors to match variations of school names to standard names.

## Testing
The model is tested on a test set and evaluated using accuracy metrics.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The model shows high accuracy on test data. It is recommended to use this model for automatic standardization of school names.

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
