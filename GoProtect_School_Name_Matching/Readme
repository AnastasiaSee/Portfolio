# Sports Schools Name Standardization using Sentence-BERT

## Objective
The goal of this project is to standardize the names of sports schools using variations provided in different datasets. We use Sentence-BERT (SBERT) to create embeddings of these names and match variations to the standard names based on their cosine similarity.

## Data
- `Школы.csv`: Contains the standard names of sports schools.
- `Примерное написание.csv`: Contains variations of the sports schools' names.

## Steps
1. Data Preparation
2. Model Training
3. Building Streamlit Application

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries can be installed using `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_folder>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the data preparation script:
    ```bash
    python data_preparation.py
    ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **0.87**.

## Conclusion
The project successfully standardized the names of sports schools using SBERT by matching variations to the standard names based on cosine similarity.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- sentence-transformers
- torch
- streamlit
